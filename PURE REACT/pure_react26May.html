       ReactDOM.render(rh1, document.getElementById("d2")) //h1 element using  react js library.
       //what is the purpose of ReactDom?
      //  Appending the react elements into the page is ReactDom

<!-- what is the purpose of document object..?
    creating element (line-12) and (line-13) we made content is  inserted in that created element
    document.getElementById('d1')---to select the element
    appendChild(jsh1)---appending also done by document object   .
    document object is there for  creating element, modifing the element an appending the element.. 

    Reactjs is a library it is only creating Elements (UI) in less code..
      The advantage with react is to create elements with less code
      library is a collection of methods
      in react we have another library to appendchild that is "ReactDom" it will also react an object that object has render


      In react JS application development processes we got new approch we got new syntax as JSX 
      var jsxh1 = <h1>Hello JSX React Element</h1> this jsx syntax is wrong  their is another library called "babbel" to convert this  jsx elements into react elements 
        why we need to convert means this react elements are good but lot of code we have to write ,but in jsx element we write less code and more declarative
